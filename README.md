- Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

- Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

- Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

- This project tackles the crucial task of 𝐢𝐝𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐮𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 in real-time, protecting consumers and financial institutions. 🌐🔬 

<br>Here's a glimpse into the process:

<br>𝟏. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐍𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

• Leveraging libraries like pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, we cleaned and normalized the transaction data.

• Missing values were addressed, and categorical features were encoded appropriately.

• We ensured data was suitable for machine learning algorithms.

<br>𝟐. 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬 𝐈𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞:

• Real-world fraud data is often imbalanced, with genuine transactions heavily outnumbering fraudulent ones.

• Techniques like oversampling or undersampling were explored to address this challenge and improve model performance.

<br>𝟑. 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

• We trained classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

• Model performance was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a robust detection system.

<br>𝟒. 𝐍𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐬:

• Experimentation with different algorithms and hyperparameter tuning for further performance optimization.

• Continuous monitoring and improvement to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

It was a fantastic learning experience exploring libraries and algorithms to build a model that can identify fraudulent transactions. ✨
